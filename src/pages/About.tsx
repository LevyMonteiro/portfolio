          I'm a Front-end web developer, I dedicate myself full time to
          programming work and studies. I consider myself passionate about
          everything that encompasses the technology area since always.

          Before dedicating myself to the area I was a volunteer in the
          technology area of my church for a few years and I also did freelance
          work in photo shoots, filming weddings, and parties in general.
